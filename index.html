                            <h2>Radical new Apple AirPods 3 redesign revealed</h2><br>
    
                            <h4>Is the classic design gone for good?</h4><br>
    
                            
                            
                           <p>
                            Since their initial release in 2016, Apple's in-ear AirPods have gone from ridicule to really cool, with the once-mocked design now ubiquitous in the streets. While subsequent Pro and Max models have shaken up the look, the originals have retained the same design for the past five years. But that could soon be about to change.
    
                            We've heard tell for a while that the third generation AirPods will sport a new design, and a new leaked photo appears to confirm the rumours. It seems the next AirPods are set to look rather a lot like the current AirPods Pro. (Check out our best AirPods deals if you're in the market for some new Apple headphones.)

                        <h2>Is this controversial Apple MacBook feature finally facing the chop?</h2><br>

                        <h4>The company seems conflicted</h4><br>

                        
                        
                       <p>
                        Not even Apple is immune from the odd design mishap. From the failure-prone Butterfly Keyboard to the mouse that can only be charged upside-down, it's fair to say that the company doesn't always get it right. And now, it seems it can't decide whether to do away with one of the MacBook Pro's most contentious features.

                            Reports suggest that the 2021 version of the MacBook Pro, one of our best laptops for graphic design, is set to say goodbye to the Touch Bar once and for all. Long derided as a more cumbersome control scheme than physical keys, the Touch Bar, first introduced in 2016, hasn't been hugely popular with MacBook users. But now, a contradictory new patent filing hints that Apple might not be finished with the Touch Bar just yet.

                        <h2>LAST CHANCE! Get Disney Plus before tomorrow's price hike</h2><br>

                        <h4>Get a cheap Disney Plus subscription while you still can.</h4><br>

                        
                        
                       <p>
                         Disney Plus is up there with the best of the streaming services, offering a treasure trove of content for families and adults, too. But if you're hanging back on signing up, it's time for action as the subscription price is going to increase tomorrow (23 February). 

                        Now really is your last chance to save, as anyone new signing up to Disney Plus from tomorrow will pay an extra 20 per cent in the UK, and 15 per cent in the US for both monthly and annual memberships. So, to access content from classic films to new TV shows for the current fee of Â£5.99/$6.99 per month, you'll need to act fast. Included in our list of the best streaming services, Disney's offering is going to get even better, with new Star shows and films about to drop.
